# üõ£Ô∏è Road Damage Detection API

### **Project Description**
This is a full-stack, end-to-end web application that uses a deep learning model to automatically detect and classify different types of road damage, such as cracks, potholes, and patched roads. The goal of this project is to showcase an impressive portfolio piece that combines deep learning, backend API development with ASP.NET Core, and a modern frontend with Next.js. 

### **Key Features**
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of a road to the web application.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: The image is sent to the backend API, which uses a pre-trained deep learning model to analyze it in real-time.
- **Damage Classification**: The API returns the locations and types of detected road damage (e.g., "Pothole," "Alligator Crack," "Longitudinal Crack").
- **Interactive Visualization**: The frontend displays the original image with bounding boxes and labels superimposed on it, highlighting the detected damage.

### **Technology Stack**
* **Deep Learning**: Python, TensorFlow
* **Backend API**: C# / ASP.NET Core
* **Frontend**: Next.js
* **Environment**: Docker (optional, for simplified deployment)
